## Preamble (run first)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.em-dash/sessions
touch ~/.em-dash/sessions/"$PPID"
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
# Detect bin directory (global install or project-level install)
_EMDASH_BIN=$([ -d ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin ] && echo ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin || echo .claude/skills/em-dash/bin)
source <("$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-slug 2>/dev/null || true)
echo "SLUG: ${SLUG:-unknown}"
mkdir -p ~/.em-dash/projects/"${SLUG:-unknown}"
_TOOLS=$("$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-tool-detect 2>/dev/null || true)
echo "$_TOOLS"
# Check for updates
"$_EMDASH_BIN"/../bin/emdash-update-check 2>/dev/null || true
```

Note: each bash block runs in a separate shell. To use bin utilities in later blocks, re-detect the path:
```bash
_EMDASH_BIN=$([ -d ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin ] && echo ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin || echo .claude/skills/em-dash/bin)
```

## Update Check

If the preamble printed `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <current> <latest>`, inform the user:

> A newer version of em-dash is available (current → latest).
> Run `cd ~/.claude/skills/em-dash && git pull && bun run build` to upgrade.

If `JUST_UPGRADED` was printed, note it and continue. Otherwise, skip this section silently.

## DISCLAIMER — Not Legal Advice

> **IMPORTANT:** This provides technical guidance for SOC 2 compliance controls. It is NOT a SOC 2 audit and does not constitute certification. Engage a licensed CPA firm for formal SOC 2 examination.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch, and the current compliance phase (e.g., "Assessment Q5 of 20", "Scanning AWS infrastructure", "Remediating encryption findings"). (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the compliance requirement in plain English. No SOC 2 Type II — Trust Service Criteria regulation numbers in the question itself — reference them in a note below.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

When an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

## Compliance Completeness Principle

**In compliance, shortcuts create audit gaps.**

A partial HIPAA scan is worse than no scan — it creates false confidence. An incomplete
remediation plan gives auditors the impression you knew about gaps and chose to ignore them.
Every skipped check is a finding your auditor will catch.

When estimating effort, always consider both scales:

| Task | Human team | CC+em-dash | Compression |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Full codebase PHI scan | 2 days | 5 min | ~50x |
| Cloud infrastructure audit | 1 week | 15 min | ~50x |
| Policy document generation | 3 days | 10 min | ~40x |
| Remediation + evidence | 2 weeks | 1 hour | ~30x |
| Gap assessment interview | 4 hours | 20 min | ~12x |

**Rule:** If the complete implementation costs minutes more than the shortcut, do the
complete thing. Every time. Compliance is not the place for "good enough."

## Contributor Mode

If this skill is running from a development checkout (symlink at `.claude/skills/em-dash`
pointing to a working directory), you are in **contributor mode**. Be aware that:
- Template changes + `bun run gen:skill-docs` immediately affect all em-dash invocations
- Run `bun test` before committing to verify skill integrity
- Breaking changes to .tmpl files can break concurrent sessions

## Completion Status Protocol

When the skill completes, report one of:
- **DONE** — All phases completed successfully. Compliance status reported.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but critical findings remain unaddressed.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed without additional information or access.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Insufficient information to assess. Ask the user to provide more.

## Evidence Collection

When collecting evidence, always:
1. Write raw tool output to `~/.em-dash/projects/$SLUG/evidence/{phase}-{datetime}/`
2. Hash evidence files: `_EMDASH_BIN=$([ -d ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin ] && echo ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin || echo .claude/skills/em-dash/bin) && "$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-evidence-hash <evidence-directory>`
3. Never store actual PHI — only configuration states, scan results, and metadata

## Review Logging

After completing a skill, log the outcome:
```bash
_EMDASH_BIN=$([ -d ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin ] && echo ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin || echo .claude/skills/em-dash/bin)
"$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-review-log write "$SLUG" "soc2" "<STATUS>" <FINDINGS_COUNT>
```

## Dashboard Sync

After logging the review, if `.em-dash/dashboard.json` exists in the project root, update the skill status:

```bash
if [ -f .em-dash/dashboard.json ]; then
  _SKILL_KEY="soc2"
  _STATUS_VAL="<STATUS>"
  _FINDINGS_VAL=<FINDINGS_COUNT>
  _SUMMARY="<ONE_LINE_SUMMARY>"
  _TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
  bun -e "
    const fs = require('fs');
    const d = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('.em-dash/dashboard.json', 'utf-8'));
    if (!d.frameworks) d.frameworks = {};
    if (!d.frameworks.hipaa) d.frameworks.hipaa = { status: 'in-progress', skills: {}, checklist: [], evidence_gaps: [] };
    d.frameworks.hipaa.skills['$_SKILL_KEY'] = {
      status: '$_STATUS_VAL'.toLowerCase(),
      timestamp: '$_TIMESTAMP',
      findings: $_FINDINGS_VAL,
      summary: '$_SUMMARY'
    };
    d.frameworks.hipaa.last_updated = '$_TIMESTAMP';
    fs.writeFileSync('.em-dash/dashboard.json', JSON.stringify(d, null, 2) + '\\n');
  " 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

**Checklist updates** are handled inline by each skill as it discovers findings — not here. Use `hipaa-dashboard-update` to update individual checklist items based on actual results:

```bash
_EMDASH_BIN=$([ -d ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin ] && echo ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin || echo .claude/skills/em-dash/bin)
# Mark a checklist item as complete with a note:
"$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-dashboard-update "164.312(a)(1)" complete "RBAC found in src/auth.ts"
# Mark as pending with an evidence gap:
"$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-dashboard-update "164.312(b)" pending --gap "No audit logging found"
# Add evidence file to an item:
"$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-dashboard-update "164.314(a)(1)" complete --evidence "baa-aws.pdf"
```

## Compliance Dashboard

Display the current compliance status by running:
```bash
_EMDASH_BIN=$([ -d ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin ] && echo ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin || echo .claude/skills/em-dash/bin)
"$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-review-log dashboard "$SLUG"
```

If no prior reviews exist, show:
```
No prior compliance work found for this project.
Recommended: Start with /hipaa-assess for an organizational assessment.
```

# SOC 2 Compliance Router

You are running the `/soc2` skill — the entry point to the SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria audit suite. Your job is to assess the current compliance state and route the user to the right sub-skill.

**Framework:** SOC 2 Type II — Trust Service Criteria (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy)

---

## Step 1: Detect Project Context

Gather information about the project and its compliance state.

```bash
_EMDASH_BIN=$([ -d ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin ] && echo ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin || echo .claude/skills/em-dash/bin)
source <("$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-slug 2>/dev/null || true)
echo "PROJECT: $SLUG"
echo "FRAMEWORK: soc2"
```

Read `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` if they exist — understand what this project does, what sensitive data it handles, and any compliance context already documented.

---

## Step 2: Check Compliance Artifacts

Look for existing SOC 2 assessment and scan artifacts:

```bash
_EMDASH_BIN=$([ -d ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin ] && echo ~/.claude/skills/em-dash/bin || echo .claude/skills/em-dash/bin)
source <("$_EMDASH_BIN"/hipaa-slug 2>/dev/null || true)
ls -t ~/.em-dash/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/*-assessment-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5
ls -t ~/.em-dash/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/*-scan-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

---

## Step 3: Route to Next Step

Based on what artifacts exist, recommend the next skill to run:

1. **No assessment found** → Recommend `/soc2-scan` to start with automated scanning (SOC 2 focuses more on technical controls than organizational interviews)
2. **Assessment exists, no scan** → Recommend `/soc2-scan`
3. **Scan exists, findings open** → Recommend remediation
4. **All phases complete** → Recommend monitoring for ongoing compliance

Present the recommendation via AskUserQuestion with options for each available skill.

## Available SOC 2 Skills

| Step | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `/soc2-scan` | Automated scanning mapped to Trust Service Criteria |
| Dashboard | `/em-dashboard` | Visual compliance dashboard at localhost:3000 |

More SOC 2 skills (assess, remediate, report, monitor) coming soon. The scanning infrastructure is shared with HIPAA — same checks, different requirement mappings.
